Use the 'npr-standalone' bundle, made executable. No libs necessary.

Plays NPR podcasts via mplayer. Default settings will play the 
appropriate program according to time of day. You can override 
this decision by providing a program name or abbreviation. 
Matching by program name is done via a loose substring search, so 
command-line use has sane defaults.
